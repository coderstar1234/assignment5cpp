This repository contains a C++ program that performs conditional actions on an integer input M and reverses the digits of M.

<h1 align="center" >Requirements:-</h1>
C++ compiler
<h1 align="center" >Usage:-</h1>
Clone this repository using the following command:

Bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/conditional-statements-and-loops-cpp.git
Change the working directory to the cloned directory:

Bash
Copy code
cd conditional-statements-and-loops-cpp
Compile the program using any C++ compiler:

Bash
Copy code
g++ program.cpp -o program
Run the program:

Bash
Copy code
./program
Enter an integer M as input when prompted.

The program will perform the following conditional actions on M:

If M is a multiple of 3 and 5, it will print "Good Number".
If M is a multiple of 3 only, it will print "Bad Number".
If M is a multiple of 5 only, it will print "Poor Number".
If M is not a multiple of 3 or 5, it will print "-1".
The program will then reverse the digits of M and print the reversed number.
